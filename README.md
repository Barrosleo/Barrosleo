# Hi there, I'm Leonardo Barros üëã

I'm a SOC Analyst passionate about threat detection, incident response, and security automation. I specialize in building modular, real-world tools that support SOC workflows, reduce alert fatigue, and strengthen cloud defenses. My hands-on experience spans SIEM engineering, forensic analysis, and Microsoft Defender integrations.

## üîç About Me

- **SOC Operations & Threat Detection**  
  I deploy SIEM technologies (Microsoft Sentinel, Defender XDR) to triage alerts, investigate incidents, and document findings using MITRE ATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks.

- **Security Automation & Incident Response**  
  I build Python, Go, and Node.js tools that automate alert enrichment, report generation, and playbook execution‚Äîstreamlining SOC operations and reducing response time.

- **Cloud Security & Posture Management**  
  I validate Azure AD, Key Vault, and Defender configurations against best practices, applying Zero Trust principles to secure hybrid environments.

- **Continuous Learning & Collaboration**  
  I actively contribute to open-source projects and stay current with threat intelligence, detection engineering, and SOC maturity models.
