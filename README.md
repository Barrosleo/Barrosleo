# Hi there, I'm Leonardo Barros ðŸ‘‹

I'm a driven Cyber Security graduate and Junior SOC Analyst passionate about threat detection, incident response, and security automation. I leverage my skills in Python, Go, and Node.js to build innovative projects that enhance SOC operations and safeguard critical systems.

## About Me

- **SOC Operations & Threat Detection:** I deploy SIEM technologies and advanced analytics to spot and mitigate security incidents.
- **Cybersecurity Automation:** I develop tools for rapid incident response, forensic analysis, and threat correlation.
- **Cloud Security:** Experienced with Azure and Zero Trust models for secure, modern architectures.
- **Continuous Learning:** I stay updated with frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and platforms such as Hack The Box.

## Key Projects

- **[forensic-timeline-dashboard](https://github.com/Barrosleo/forensic-timeline-dashboard)** (Go)  
  Aggregates logs from multiple sources, normalizes timestamps, and visualizes a chronological forensic timeline with an interactive dashboard.
  
- **[incident-response-automation](https://github.com/Barrosleo/incident-response-automation)** (Node.js)  
  Automates incident response by executing playbooks that isolate endpoints, send notifications, log events, and generate incident reports.
  
- **[cyber-threat-intel-aggregator](https://github.com/Barrosleo/cyber-threat-intel-aggregator)** (Python)  
  Aggregates threat intelligence from open-source feeds and internal SIEM logs, normalizing and correlating data to detect compromise events.
  
- **[cloud-casb-insider-risk-analyzer](https://github.com/Barrosleo/cloud-casb-insider-risk-analyzer)** (Python)  
  Simulates cloud/CASB log data and applies behavioral analytics to flag anomalies, calculate risk scores, and display real-time risk trends.
  
- **[insider-threat-hunting-automation-tool](https://github.com/Barrosleo/insider-threat-hunting-automation-tool)** (Python)  
  Hunts insider threats by aggregating simulated logs, applying correlation rules to flag anomalies, executing response playbooks, and sending alerts.
  
- **[dlp-policy-simulator](https://github.com/Barrosleo/dlp-policy-simulator)** (Python)  
  Simulates insider threat events to identify control gaps in DLP systems by mapping events against policy rules and generating risk scores.
  
- **[insider-threat-detection-dashboard](https://github.com/Barrosleo/insider-threat-detection-dashboard)** (Python)  
  Aggregates synthetic SIEM logs, applies anomaly detection algorithms, and visualizes insider threat indicators via an interactive dashboard.
  
- **[soc-playbook-automation-and-execution-simulator](https://github.com/Barrosleo/soc-playbook-automation-and-execution-simulator)** (Python)  
  Simulates SOC incident response playbooks with automated notifications, detailed logging, and incident report generation.
  
- **[soc-forensic-timeline-and-analysis-dashboard](https://github.com/Barrosleo/soc-forensic-timeline-and-analysis-dashboard)** (Python)  
  Reconstructs forensic timelines from synthetic logs, visualizes event correlations, and provides automated analysis reports.
  
- **[Automated-Phishing-Detection-Response](https://github.com/Barrosleo/Automated-Phishing-Detection-Response)** (Python)  
  Detects phishing threats using NLP, automates the response process, and generates detailed incident reports.
  
- **[Threat-Intelligence-Aggregator](https://github.com/Barrosleo/Threat-Intelligence-Aggregator)** (Python)  
  Aggregates and correlates threat intelligence data with internal logs to detect potential breaches.
  
- **[SOC-Incident-Response-Simulator](https://github.com/Barrosleo/SOC-Incident-Response-Simulator)** (Python)  
  Ingests synthetic logs, triages alerts, visualizes incidents, and generates automated SOC incident reports.
