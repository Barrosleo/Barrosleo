# Hi there, I'm Leonardo Barros ðŸ‘‹

I'm a driven Cyber Security graduate and Junior SOC Analyst passionate about threat detection, incident response, and security automation. My hands-on experience across SOC operations, cloud security, and forensic analysis helps me prioritize alerts, investigate incidents, and build automated tools that close information gaps and strengthen defenses.

## About Me

- **SOC Operations & Threat Detection:**
  I deploy SIEM technologies and analytics to rapidly triage security alerts, perform root cause investigations, and remediate incidents.
- **Cybersecurity Automation & Incident Response:**
  I develop tools in Python, Go, and Node.js that automate investigations, incident documentation, and forensic analysis.
- **Cloud Security & Defense:**
  With expertise in Azure and Zero Trust models, I secure modern infrastructures and enhance cloud defenses.
- **Continuous Learning & Collaboration:**
  I stay current with MITRE ATT&CK frameworks and best practices to innovate and drive impactful security improvements.
